# NCSC-Task

I have used MERN Stack for this project for building the full stack.
M: MongoDB – database

E: Express JS – server tier

R: React JS – front end

N: Node JS – backend + server tier 

Additionally:

-  I have used bootstrap 5 and fontawesome site to make the front-end more appealing
-  I also have used Postman App to design, build, test and iterate the API. -
-  ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets- VS Code Extension 

Comments:
-   When you click on the “View” Button, you will be able to see the user’s details as well as you can delete or edit the user.
-  The Age code does not show up on the UI, but the code is available in (route.js)
-  The image uploading sometimes does not work,it shows the path rather than the image itself
